# clj-xai

A Clojure library and JVM toolkit for explainable AI/ML. The initial aim is to implement parcimonious,
rule-based ML algorithms such as the Bayesian algorithms described in the works of Rudin & al.

Available algorithms:
- Bayesian Rule Lists
- Bayesian Rule Sets

## Usage (library)

## Usage (command line)

## Roadmap
- Integrate roaring bitmaps
- use GPU for fast likelihood computations
- DD modeling
